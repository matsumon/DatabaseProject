Project Name:
CS340_DBProject – User Authentication Prototype Group

Project Outline

Our project simulates the behaviors and storage patterns of a Single Sign On Provider. Henceforth referred to as SSO or Single Sign On. This website will allow users to update user info, roles, and credentials depending on permission levels by using the website. User sessions will be tracked by a SQL table and updated by the website. We anticipate that this system will be capable of recording a million records with little problems. Further In accordance with the requirements laid out in the following documents and the requirements of Oregon State University E-Campus CS340 “Introduction to Databases” course.

READ/ADD operations for a user  
READ/ADD/UPDATE(a foreign key)  operations for a credential  
READ/ADD  operations for a role  
READ/ADD operations for a session  
CREATE/READ/DELETE/UPDATE operations for the action table  
Sign on into our application  
Log off from our application

ADD/READ/UPDATE(a single key)  operations for a credential  
ADD/READ  operations for a role  
ADD/READ operations for a session
